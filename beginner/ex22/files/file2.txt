The old house stood silently on the hill, its windows like vacant eyes.
A tiny hummingbird darted among the fuchsia blossoms.
She carefully arranged the colorful spices on the kitchen counter.
The rhythmic crash of waves echoed along the deserted beach.
He whistled a cheerful tune as he walked down the dusty road.
Sunlight streamed through the leaves, dappling the forest floor.

A mischievous squirrel chattered at them from a tree branch.
They watched the stars slowly emerge in the twilight sky.
The sound of distant thunder rumbled, signaling an approaching storm.
